  "content": "From above, birds must have a wonderful view of the world below. Flying over everything at such a height gives them a rare ability to see many things.

In English, we use the term “bird’s eye view” to describe a view from above as if seen by a bird in flight. It is also described as an “overall view” or “big picture view.

For example, when I start a project, I first like to get a bird’s eye view. I ask myself several important questions: What is the overall goal? Who is the main focus? What resources do I have available to me? Answers to these “big picture” questions can help me understand the scope of the project.

Now, let's talk about noticing the smaller details.

Some birds, called raptors, are known for their extremely sharp vision. Eagles, hawks, and owls can see their prey from very far away.

The Raptor Center is part of the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Its website explains why eagles, hawks, and owls see so well: “Raptors have powerful binocular vision, where both their left and right eyes can see and focus on a single object.”

Eagles and hawks also have a special bone structure around their eyes that protects them from bright sunlight. Their ability to focus on faraway details in addition to other factors make them extremely effective hunters.

In English, the keen vision of eagles and hawks describes a certain type of person.

If you have an eagle eye, you have the ability to see or notice distant objects. Also, you observe everything, even very small details which others might miss. On the same note, someone who is hawk-eyed watches and notices everything that happens.

These types of people may even perceive things that are not clear to others. Both eagle-eyed and hawk-eyed people are observant or perceptive.

A person does not have to have this ability all the time. They might use their keen vision and powers of observation only at certain times, especially times when they need to keep a close watch.

For example, during Christmastime, hawk-eyed children might search the sky looking for Santa Claus. These children may not be very observant during the rest of the year, but during Christmastime, they are looking for gifts.

Let’s hear these terms used between two friends.

A: This is a great party. Thanks for inviting me.

B: The more the merrier! This yearly neighborhood party always draws a huge number of people.

A: I’d say so! There must be over a hundred people here! Hey, wait a minute. I think I see our old co-worker. Isn’t that Samantha way over there by the food and drinks?

B: I don’t know. I can’t see that far.

A: It’s her. My eagle eyes don’t miss a thing. I’m going to go say hi and grab the last hamburger while I’m there. Oh, and you should let the hosts know that they’re low on drinks.

B: Wow! You’re right. I didn’t realize you were so hawk-eyed.

A: Only at parties. I start off with a bird’s eye view and then focus in on the food, drinks, and people I want to see more closely. See you in a few…

The term “eagle eye” has been used for hundreds of years. Word experts say it was first used in writing in the mid-1500s. The Oxford English Dictionary website says the “earliest evidence for ‘eagle eye’ is from 1567, in the writing of Thomas Stapleton, a Roman Catholic theologian.”

"translation": "从高空俯瞰，鸟类想必能将下方世界的景色尽收眼底。在如此高度翱翔，赋予了它们罕见的广阔视野。在英语里，我们用 “鸟瞰” 这个说法来描述从高空向下眺望的视角，仿佛是飞鸟在翱翔时看到的画面。它也可被解释为 “全局视角” 或 “整体视角”。比如，当我启动一个项目时，首先会想要把握全局。我会问自己几个关键问题：项目的整体目标是什么？核心受众是谁？我手头有哪些可用资源？这些关乎全局的问题的答案，能帮我厘清项目的范围。 现在，我们来聊聊捕捉细微之处的能力。有一类名为猛禽的鸟类，以其超凡敏锐的视力而闻名。鹰、隼和猫头鹰能从极远的地方锁定猎物。明尼苏达大学兽医学院旗下设有猛禽研究中心，该中心官网解释了鹰、隼和猫头鹰拥有绝佳视力的原因：“猛禽具备强大的双目视觉，它们的左右眼能够同时聚焦于同一个物体。” 此外，鹰和隼的眼眶周围还有特殊的骨骼结构，可保护眼睛免受强光照射。正是这种聚焦远方细节的能力，再加上其他因素，让它们成为了捕猎高手。 在英语中，人们会用鹰和隼敏锐的视力来形容一类人。如果你拥有 “鹰眼”，就意味着你能看清或留意到远处的物体，并且善于观察周遭的一切，哪怕是旁人极易忽略的细微之处。同理，“目光锐利的人” 会密切留意身边发生的所有事，甚至能察觉到他人难以发现的端倪。无论是 “鹰眼般敏锐的人” 还是 “目光锐利的人”，都属于观察力强、洞察力敏锐的类型。 这种敏锐的观察力并非需要时刻在线。人们可能只会在特定时刻，尤其是需要密切关注事物的时刻，才会调动这种敏锐的视觉和观察力。例如，在圣诞节期间，孩子们会睁大眼睛仰望天空，搜寻圣诞老人的身影。平日里，这些孩子或许算不上观察力出众，但到了圣诞节，因为满心期待礼物，他们的目光就会变得格外敏锐。 我们来听听两个朋友的对话中是如何运用这些表达的。 A：这场派对太棒了，谢谢你邀请我。 B：人越多越热闹嘛！这场一年一度的邻里派对总能吸引大批人前来。 A：可不是嘛！这儿少说也有上百人了！嘿，等一下，我好像看到我们以前的同事了。在那边餐饮区附近的人，是不是萨曼莎？ B：我看不清，我没那么好的眼力。 A：就是她。我的 “鹰眼” 可是火眼金睛，什么都逃不过。我这就过去打个招呼，顺便把最后一个汉堡拿走。对了，你得提醒一下主办方，饮料快不够了。 B：哇！还真是！我都没发现你居然这么眼尖。 A：也就在派对上才这样啦。我先是扫视全场、把握大局，然后再聚焦到美食、饮料，还有那些我想好好聊聊的人身上。待会儿见啦…… “鹰眼” 这个说法已经沿用了数百年。词汇专家表示，它最早在 16 世纪中期被写入文字记载。《牛津英语词典》官网显示：“‘鹰眼’一词最早的文字记录出自 1567 年，见于罗马天主教神学家托马斯・斯特普尔顿的著作中。” 神学家指的是研究宗教思想的专家。","vocabulary": [{"word": "view","part of speech": "noun","meaning": "从某个位置或地点能看到的事物"},{"word": "focus","part of speech": "noun; verb","meaning": "名词：占据某人大部分注意力的事物；动词：使眼睛看到的影像尽可能清晰"},{"word": "notice","part of speech": "verb","meaning": "看到并留意到某事"},{"word": "prey","part of speech": "noun","meaning": "被猎捕的动物"},{"word": "binocular","part of speech": "adjective","meaning": "涉及双眼的"},{"word": "perceive","part of speech": "verb","meaning": "理解"},{"word": "bird’s eye view","part of speech": "noun phrase","meaning": "从高处向下看到的景象，或对事物的全局视角"},{"word": "raptor","part of speech": "noun","meaning": "猛禽（如鹰、隼、猫头鹰这类捕食其他动物的鸟类）"},{"word": "binocular vision","part of speech": "noun phrase","meaning": "双目视觉（双眼同时聚焦于同一物体，产生立体感的视觉能力）"},{"word": "eagle eye","part of speech": "noun phrase","meaning": "敏锐的视力；洞悉一切的能力（能发现他人忽略的细微之处）"},{"word": "hawk-eyed","part of speech": "adjective","meaning": "目光锐利的，善于观察的"},{"word": "observant","part of speech": "adjective","meaning": "善于观察的"},{"word": "theologian","part of speech": "noun","meaning": "神学家（研究宗教思想的专家）"},{"word": "scope","part of speech": "noun","meaning": "某个主题、活动、书籍等所涉及的范围"}]},

  "translation": " 一块八毛七分。就这么多了。其中六毛钱是一分一分的硬币。这些硬币是她每次跟杂货铺老板、菜贩和肉铺老板死缠烂打，一分两分地省下来的，每次这样斤斤计较，都让她脸颊发烫，因为这种精打细算暗含着吝啬的无声指责。德拉数了三遍，还是一块八毛七分。而明天就是圣诞节了。  显然，除了扑倒在那张破旧的小沙发上嚎啕大哭，再也没别的办法了。德拉就这么做了。这不禁让人引发道德思考：生活是由哭泣、抽噎和微笑组成的，而抽噎占了大多数。  就在这家的女主人慢慢从第一阶段（哭泣）平复到第二阶段（抽噎）时，我们来看看这个家吧。这是一套每周租金八美元的带家具公寓。虽然算不上难以形容的简陋，但也确实差一点就需要救济队来关照了。  楼下门厅里有个信箱，从来没有信件投进去；还有个电铃，任凭谁的手指也按不响。旁边还挂着一张卡片，上面写着“詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·扬先生”。  “迪林厄姆”这几个字是在以前家境好的时候加上去的，那时男主人每周能挣三十美元。现在，收入缩减到二十美元，“迪林厄姆”这几个字显得模糊不清，仿佛在认真考虑缩成一个谦逊低调的“迪”字。但每当詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·扬先生回到家，走进楼上的公寓时，就会被詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·扬太太——也就是我们已经认识的德拉——亲切地叫着“吉姆”，并紧紧抱住。这一切都无比美好。  德拉哭完，用粉扑擦了擦脸颊。她站在窗边，无精打采地望着窗外一只灰色的猫在灰色的篱笆上走，背景是灰色的后院。明天就是圣诞节了，可她只有一块八毛七分来给吉姆买礼物。这是她好几个月来一分一分省下来的结果。每周二十美元实在经不起花，开销总是比她预想的要大。向来如此。只有一块八毛七分，要买一份给吉姆的礼物。她的吉姆啊。她曾花了多少快乐的时光，盘算着要给吉姆买件好东西——一件精致、稀有、贵重的东西，一件配得上吉姆拥有的东西。  房间的两扇窗户之间有一面穿衣镜。也许你见过八美元租金公寓里的穿衣镜吧。一个非常瘦削、动作敏捷的人，只要快速地从镜子的纵向条纹里看自己的倒影，就能大致准确地看清自己的模样。德拉身材苗条，早已掌握了这门技巧。  突然，她猛地转过身，站到镜子前。眼睛里闪烁着明亮的光芒，但不到二十秒，脸色就变得苍白。她飞快地撩起头发，让它披散到最长。  詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·扬夫妇有两件最引以为傲的宝贝。一件是吉姆的金表，那是他父亲传给祖父，再传给她的。另一件就是德拉的头发。要是示巴女王住在对面的通风井旁，德拉总有一天会把头发垂到窗外晾干，只为让女王的珠宝和礼物都黯然失色。要是所罗门王当看门人，把他所有的财宝都堆在地下室里，吉姆每次经过都会掏出金表，只为看所罗门王羡慕得扯胡子。  此刻，德拉美丽的头发披散在肩头，像一股棕色的瀑布，波浪起伏，闪闪发光。头发垂到膝盖以下，几乎成了她的一件衣裳。然后，她又紧张又迅速地把头发梳好。有那么一瞬间，她犹豫了，站在原地不动，一两滴眼泪落在磨损的红地毯上。  她穿上旧棕色外套，戴上旧棕色帽子，裙摆一旋，眼睛里依旧闪烁着光芒，匆匆出门，走下楼梯，来到街上。  她在一个招牌前停下，上面写着：“索弗朗妮夫人，各类毛发制品”。德拉一口气跑上一楼，定了定神，气喘吁吁。夫人身材高大，皮肤太白，神情冷漠，一点也不像“索弗朗妮”这个名字给人的感觉。  “你买头发吗？”德拉问。  “我买头发，”夫人说，“把帽子摘下来，让我看看。”  棕色的瀑布垂了下来。  “二十美元，”夫人用熟练的手托了托头发，说道。  “快给我钱，”德拉说。  接下来的两个小时，时光仿佛乘着玫瑰色的翅膀飞逝而过。别管这个蹩脚的比喻了。她在各家商店里疯狂搜寻给吉姆的礼物。  终于，她找到了。这件礼物简直就是为吉姆量身定做的，再适合不过别人了。她把所有商店都翻遍了，再也没有找到第二件。那是一条铂金表链，设计简洁大方，仅凭材质就彰显出价值，没有丝毫花哨的装饰——就像所有好东西都该有的样子。它甚至配得上那块金表。一看到它，德拉就知道，这一定是吉姆的。它和吉姆很像：沉稳而珍贵，这个描述对两者都适用。她花了二十一美元买下它，然后拿着剩下的七十八美分匆匆回了家。有了这条表链，吉姆无论在什么场合，都可以大大方方地看时间了。尽管金表很贵重，但他以前因为用旧皮表带代替表链，总是偷偷摸摸地看。  德拉回到家，激动的心情渐渐被谨慎和理智取代。她拿出卷发棒，点燃煤气，开始修补因爱而生的慷慨所造成的“破坏”。亲爱的朋友们，这向来是一项艰巨的任务——一项浩大的任务。  四十分钟后，她的头上布满了小小的、紧紧贴着头皮的卷发，让她看起来活像个逃学的小男孩。她对着镜子长时间、仔细、挑剔地看着自己的倒影。  “要是吉姆第一眼看到我不杀了我，”她自言自语道，“他也会说我像科尼岛的歌舞女郎。可我有什么办法呢——哦！一块八毛七分能做什么呢？”  七点钟，咖啡煮好了，煎锅放在炉子后面，热得发烫，随时可以煎排骨了。  吉姆从不迟到。德拉把表链对折握在手里，坐在桌子角上，靠近吉姆总是进来的那扇门。然后，她听到楼下第一段楼梯上传来他的脚步声，脸色瞬间变得苍白。她有个习惯，会为日常琐事默默祈祷，现在她轻声念道：“求求你，上帝，让他觉得我依然漂亮。”  门开了，吉姆走了进来，关上了门。他看起来很瘦，神情十分严肃。可怜的人，他才二十二岁，就要肩负起一个家庭的重担！他需要一件新大衣，连手套都没有。  吉姆走进门，像一只闻到鹌鹑气味的猎犬一样，一动不动。他的眼睛死死地盯着德拉，眼神里有一种她看不懂的表情，让她感到害怕。那不是愤怒，不是惊讶，不是不满，不是恐惧，也不是她预想中的任何一种情绪。他只是带着那种奇怪的表情，定定地看着她。  德拉从桌子上跳下来，向他走去。  “吉姆，亲爱的，”她喊道，“别那样看着我。我把头发剪了卖了，因为不送你一份圣诞礼物，我实在过不下去。头发还会再长出来的——你不会介意的，对吗？我必须这么做。我的头发长得很快。说‘圣诞快乐’吧，吉姆，让我们开心点。你不知道我给你准备了一份多么好的——多么漂亮、精致的礼物。”  “你把头发剪了？”吉姆吃力地问道，仿佛经过了最艰难的思考，才得出这个显而易见的事实。  “剪了，卖了，”德拉说，“不管怎样，你还是一样爱我，对吗？没有头发，我还是我，不是吗？”  吉姆好奇地环顾了一下房间。  “你说你的头发没了？”他说，语气近乎白痴。  “你不用找了，”德拉说，“我告诉你，它卖了——卖了，再也找不回来了。今天是圣诞夜，亲爱的。对我好一点，因为我是为了你才这么做的。也许我的头发是有数的，”她突然带着一种严肃而温柔的语气继续说道，“但没人能数清我对你的爱。我把排骨煎上吧，吉姆？”  吉姆仿佛从恍惚中猛然惊醒。他抱住了德拉。让我们用十秒钟的时间，得体地把目光转向别处，看看某个无关紧要的东西吧。每周八美元也好，每年一百万也好，有什么区别呢？数学家或智者可能会给你错误的答案。麦琪带来了珍贵的礼物，但其中并没有这种东西。这个晦涩的说法稍后会解释清楚。  吉姆从大衣口袋里掏出一个包裹，扔在桌子上。  “别误会我，德拉，”他说，“我觉得不管是理发、刮胡子还是洗头，都不会让我减少对你的爱。但如果你拆开这个包裹，就会明白为什么一开始我会愣住了。”  白皙灵巧的手指飞快地撕开绳子和包装纸。接着是一声狂喜的尖叫，可紧接着，唉！她突然像女人那样歇斯底里地哭了起来，吉姆不得不立刻用尽全身解数来安慰她。  因为里面躺着的是梳子——一套边梳和后梳，是德拉在百老汇一家商店的橱窗里渴望了很久的东西。美丽的梳子，纯玳瑁材质，边缘镶嵌着珠宝，颜色正好配她那已经剪掉的美丽头发。她知道这梳子很贵，心里一直渴望得到它，却从未奢望过能拥有。现在，梳子是她的了，但本该佩戴这珍贵饰品的头发却没了。  但她还是把梳子紧紧抱在怀里，过了好一会儿，才抬起含泪的眼睛，微笑着说：“我的头发长得很快，吉姆！”  然后，德拉像一只被烫到的小猫一样跳了起来，喊道：“哦，哦！”  吉姆还没看到他那件漂亮的礼物呢。她急切地把礼物放在摊开的手掌上递给他。那暗淡的贵金属仿佛反射出她炽热而真诚的灵魂。  “是不是很棒，吉姆？我全城都找遍了才找到它。现在你一天得看一百次时间了。把你的表给我，我想看看表链戴在上面好不好看。”  吉姆没有照做，而是倒在沙发上，双手枕在脑后，笑了起来。  “德拉，”他说，“我们把圣诞礼物收起来吧，先放一段时间。现在用太可惜了。我把表卖了，才有钱给你买梳子。现在，不如你把排骨煎上吧。”  你知道，麦琪是智者——非常有智慧的人，他们给马槽里的婴儿带来了礼物。是他们发明了送圣诞礼物的习俗。既然是智者，他们的礼物无疑也是明智的，也许还附带了重复时可以交换的特权。而我在这里笨拙地向你讲述了公寓里两个傻孩子的平淡故事，他们极其不明智地为对方牺牲了家里最珍贵的宝贝。但最后，我要对当今的智者说：在所有送礼的人中，这两个是最明智的。在所有送礼和收礼的人中，像他们这样的人才是最明智的。无论在哪里，他们都是最明智的。他们就是麦琪。",

  "content": "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.

There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.

While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.

In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."

The "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.

Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.

There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.

Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.

Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.

So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.

On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.

Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie."

"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.

"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it."

Down rippled the brown cascade.

"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.

"Give it to me quick" said Della.

Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.

She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.

When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.

Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.

"If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"

At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.

Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please, God, make him think I am still pretty."

The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was with out gloves.

Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.

Della wriggled off the table and went for him.

"Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you."

"You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.

"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?"

Jim looked about the room curiously.

"You say your hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.

"You needn't look for it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"

Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.

Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.

"Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first."

White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.

For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.

But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"

And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"

Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.

"Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."

Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.

"Dell," said he, "let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on."

The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.",

"translation":  很久以前，有一位旅人踏上了一段旅程。这是一段奇妙的旅程，刚开始时仿佛漫长无尽，可走到半途，又觉得转瞬即逝。  他在一条颇为昏暗的小路上走了一阵子，沿途什么也没遇见，最后终于碰到了一个可爱的孩子。于是他问孩子：“你在这里做什么？”孩子答道：“我一直在玩耍呀。来和我一起玩吧！”  就这样，他和那个孩子玩了一整天，过得无比开心。天空湛蓝，阳光明媚，溪水粼粼，树叶翠绿，花朵娇艳，他们听着鸟鸣，看着蝴蝶纷飞，一切都美好极了。这是晴朗天气里的景象。下雨时，他们喜欢看雨滴坠落，闻清新的泥土芬芳。刮风时，听着风声也别有乐趣，还会猜想风从遥远的家（他们好奇，那会是哪里呢！）狂奔而来时在诉说着什么——它呼啸着、怒吼着，驱赶着云朵，折弯了树木，在烟囱里隆隆作响，摇晃着房屋，让大海怒涛翻滚。可下雪的时候是最好的了：他们最爱抬头看洁白的雪花密密麻麻地飘落，像无数白鸟胸前的绒毛；看积雪堆得又平又厚；听小径和道路上一片寂静。  他们有世界上最精致的玩具，还有最奇妙的图画书——书里全是关于弯刀、拖鞋、头巾，小矮人、巨人、精灵和仙女，蓝胡子、魔豆藤、宝藏、洞穴、森林、情人节卡片和奥森的故事，全都是崭新的，也全都是真实的。  然而有一天，旅人突然找不到那个孩子了。他一遍又一遍地呼唤，却没有任何回应。于是他继续赶路，又走了一阵子，什么也没遇见，最后碰到了一个英俊的男孩。他问男孩：“你在这里做什么？”男孩答道：“我一直在学习呀。来和我一起学习吧！”  于是他和那个男孩一起学习——学习朱庇特与朱诺，学习希腊人和罗马人，还有许多我叫不上名字的东西，学到的内容多得我说不完，他自己后来也忘了一大半。但他们并不总是在学习，还玩过最欢快的游戏：夏天在河里划船，冬天在冰上滑冰；徒步健行，骑马驰骋；打板球、玩各种球类游戏；玩“抓俘虏”“追猎”“跟我做”，还有好多我想不起来的运动——没人能比得过他们。他们还有假期，有主显节蛋糕，有可以跳舞到午夜的派对，还有真正的剧院——在那里，他们能看到真金白银打造的宫殿从真实的土地上拔地而起，一瞬间看完世界上所有的奇观。至于朋友，他们有那么多亲密的伙伴，我都数不过来。这些朋友都和那个英俊的男孩一样年轻，一辈子都不会彼此疏远。  可即便如此，有一天，在这些欢乐之中，旅人还是像失去那个孩子一样，失去了这个男孩。他徒劳地呼唤着，然后继续踏上旅程。又走了一阵子，他什么也没看见，最后碰到了一个年轻人。他问年轻人：“你在这里做什么？”年轻人答道：“我一直在恋爱呀。来和我一起恋爱吧！”  于是他跟着那个年轻人往前走，很快就见到了一个世间少有的漂亮姑娘——就像坐在角落里的范妮一样，眼睛像范妮，头发像范妮，酒窝也像范妮，就连我说起她时，她笑起来脸红的模样都和范妮一模一样。年轻人立刻就爱上了她——就像某个我不点名的人，第一次来这里时爱上范妮那样。嗯！他有时会被姑娘捉弄——就像某个人和范妮以前那样；他们有时也会吵架——就像某个人和范妮以前那样；但他们总会和好，会坐在黑暗里，每天写信，分开一刻就不开心，总在偷偷留意对方却假装没有，在圣诞节订了婚，坐在炉火边紧紧挨着，很快就要结婚了——这一切都和某个我不点名的人以及范妮一模一样！  可后来有一天，旅人还是失去了他们，就像失去之前所有的朋友一样。他呼唤他们回来，却没有回应，只能继续赶路。又走了一阵子，他什么也没看见，最后碰到了一位中年绅士。他问绅士：“你在这里做什么？”绅士答道：“我一直在忙碌呀。来和我一起忙碌吧！”  于是他开始跟着那位绅士忙碌起来，两人一同穿过树林。这段旅程全程都在树林里，只是一开始树林开阔而翠绿，像春天的森林；现在却变得茂密而昏暗，像夏天的森林；一些最早发芽的小树甚至已经开始变黄。绅士并非独自一人，身边跟着一位年纪相仿的女士，那是他的妻子；他们还有几个孩子，也一同随行。于是他们一行人并肩穿过树林，砍倒树木，在树枝和落叶间开辟道路，扛着重物，辛勤劳作。  有时，他们会走到一条长长的绿色林荫道，道路通向更深的树林。这时，他们会听到遥远的地方传来一个小小的声音呼喊：“爸爸，爸爸，我是另一个孩子呀！等等我！”很快，就会看到一个小小的身影朝他们跑来，越跑越大。身影跑近后，大家都会围上去，亲吻它、欢迎它，然后一起继续赶路。  有时，他们会同时遇到好几条林荫道。这时大家都会停下脚步，一个孩子说：“爸爸，我要去航海。”另一个说：“爸爸，我要去印度。”还有一个说：“爸爸，我要去别处寻找我的运气。”最后一个说：“爸爸，我要去天堂！”于是，在依依不舍的泪水中，孩子们各自踏上了不同的林荫道，独自前行；而那个要去天堂的孩子，缓缓升入金色的天空，渐渐消失了。  每当这样的离别发生时，旅人都会看向绅士，看见他抬头望向树林上方的天空——那时天色已开始变暗，夕阳即将西下。旅人还发现，绅士的头发已经开始变白。但他们从来不能久留，因为旅程还在继续，他们必须一直忙碌。  最后，经历了太多次离别，身边的孩子都走光了，只剩下旅人和绅士夫妇继续同行。这时树林已经泛黄，接着又变成褐色，就连参天大树的叶子也开始飘落。  他们走到一条比其他林荫道都要昏暗的路口，正埋头赶路，没有留意那条路，女士却突然停了下来。  “我的丈夫，”女士说，“有人在叫我。”  他们仔细听，听到林荫道深处传来一个声音：“妈妈，妈妈！”  那是第一个说“我要去天堂”的孩子的声音。父亲说：“求求你，再等等。夕阳就快落山了。求求你，再等等！”  可那个声音不顾他的恳求，依旧呼喊着：“妈妈，妈妈！”此时绅士的头发已经全白了，脸上满是泪水。  随后，已经走进昏暗林荫道阴影里的母亲，依旧搂着他的脖子，亲吻了他，说：“我最亲爱的，我被召唤了，我要走了！”说完便消失了。只剩下旅人和绅士独自前行。  他们继续并肩走着，直到快走到树林的尽头——近得能看见夕阳的红光穿过树林，映照在前方。  然而，就在绅士奋力拨开树枝开路时，旅人又一次失去了他的朋友。他一遍又一遍地呼唤，却没有任何回应。当他走出树林，看见宁静的夕阳映照在广阔的紫色天际时，发现一位老人坐在一棵倒下的树干上。于是他问老人：“你在这里做什么？”老人平静地笑着说：“我一直在回忆呀。来和我一起回忆吧！”  旅人在老人身边坐下，面对着安详的夕阳。这时，他所有的朋友都轻轻走了回来，围在他身边——那个可爱的孩子、英俊的男孩、陷入爱恋的年轻人，还有父亲、母亲和孩子们，每一个人都在那里，他什么也没有失去。于是他爱着他们每一个人，对他们都温柔而宽容，满心欢喜地注视着他们；而他们也都尊敬并爱着他。我想，这位旅人一定就是你，亲爱的爷爷——因为你对我们就是这样，我们对你也是这样。",

  "content": "Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there was a traveller, and he set out upon a journey. It was a magic journey, and was to seem very long when he began it, and very short when he got half way through.

He travelled along a rather dark path for some little time, without meeting anything, until at last he came to a beautiful child. So he said to the child, "What do you do here?" And the child said, "I am always at play. Come and play with me!"

So, he played with that child, the whole day long, and they were very merry. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers were so lovely, and they heard such singing-birds and saw so many butterflies, that everything was beautiful. This was in fine weather. When it rained, they loved to watch the falling drops, and to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it was delightful to listen to the wind, and fancy what it said, as it came rushing from its home-- where was that, they wondered!--whistling and howling, driving the clouds before it, bending the trees, rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and making the sea roar in fury. But, when it snowed, that was best of all; for, they liked nothing so well as to look up at the white flakes falling fast and thick, like down from the breasts of millions of white birds; and to see how smooth and deep the drift was; and to listen to the hush upon the paths and roads.

They had plenty of the finest toys in the world, and the most astonishing picture-books: all about scimitars and slippers and turbans, and dwarfs and giants and genii and fairies, and blue-beards and bean-stalks and riches and caverns and forests and Valentines and Orsons: and all new and all true.

But, one day, of a sudden, the traveller lost the child. He called to him over and over again, but got no answer. So, he went upon his road, and went on for a little while without meeting anything, until at last he came to a handsome boy. So, he said to the boy, "What do you do here?" And the boy said, "I am always learning. Come and learn with me."

So he learned with that boy about Jupiter and Juno, and the Greeks and the Romans, and I don't know what, and learned more than I could tell--or he either, for he soon forgot a great deal of it. But, they were not always learning; they had the merriest games that ever were played. They rowed upon the river in summer, and skated on the ice in winter; they were active afoot, and active on horseback; at cricket, and all games at ball; at prisoner's base, hare and hounds, follow my leader, and more sports than I can think of; nobody could beat them. They had holidays too, and Twelfth cakes, and parties where they danced till midnight, and real Theatres where they saw palaces of real gold and silver rise out of the real earth, and saw all the wonders of the world at once. As to friends, they had such dear friends and so many of them, that I want the time to reckon them up. They were all young, like the handsome boy, and were never to be strange to one another all their lives through.

Still, one day, in the midst of all these pleasures, the traveller lost the boy as he had lost the child, and, after calling to him in vain, went on upon his journey. So he went on for a little while without seeing anything, until at last he came to a young man. So, he said to the young man, "What do you do here?" And the young man said, "I am always in love. Come and love with me."

So, he went away with that young man, and presently they came to one of the prettiest girls that ever was seen--just like Fanny in the corner there--and she had eyes like Fanny, and hair like Fanny, and dimples like Fanny's, and she laughed and coloured just as Fanny does while I am talking about her. So, the young man fell in love directly--just as Somebody I won't mention, the first time he came here, did with Fanny. Well! he was teased sometimes--just as Somebody used to be by Fanny; and they quarrelled sometimes--just as Somebody and Fanny used to quarrel; and they made it up, and sat in the dark, and wrote letters every day, and never were happy asunder, and were always looking out for one another and pretending not to, and were engaged at Christmas-time, and sat close to one another by the fire, and were going to be married very soon--all exactly like Somebody I won't mention, and Fanny!

But, the traveller lost them one day, as he had lost the rest of his friends, and, after calling to them to come back, which they never did, went on upon his journey. So, he went on for a little while without seeing anything, until at last he came to a middle-aged gentleman. So, he said to the gentleman, "What are you doing here?" And his answer was, "I am always busy. Come and be busy with me!"

So, he began to be very busy with that gentleman, and they went on through the wood together. The whole journey was through a wood, only it had been open and green at first, like a wood in spring; and now began to be thick and dark, like a wood in summer; some of the little trees that had come out earliest, were even turning brown. The gentleman was not alone, but had a lady of about the same age with him, who was his Wife; and they had children, who were with them too. So, they all went on together through the wood, cutting down the trees, and making a path through the branches and the fallen leaves, and carrying burdens, and working hard.

Sometimes, they came to a long green avenue that opened into deeper woods. Then they would hear a very little, distant voice crying, "Father, father, I am another child! Stop for me!" And presently they would see a very little figure, growing larger as it came along, running to join them. When it came up, they all crowded round it, and kissed and welcomed it; and then they all went on together.

Sometimes, they came to several avenues at once, and then they all stood still, and one of the children said, "Father, I am going to sea," and another said, "Father, I am going to India," and another, "Father, I am going to seek my fortune where I can," and another, "Father, I am going to Heaven!" So, with many tears at parting, they went, solitary, down those avenues, each child upon its way; and the child who went to Heaven, rose into the golden air and vanished.

Whenever these partings happened, the traveller looked at the gentleman, and saw him glance up at the sky above the trees, where the day was beginning to decline, and the sunset to come on. He saw, too, that his hair was turning grey. But, they never could rest long, for they had their journey to perform, and it was necessary for them to be always busy.

At last, there had been so many partings that there were no children left, and only the traveller, the gentleman, and the lady, went upon their way in company. And now the wood was yellow; and now brown; and the leaves, even of the forest trees, began to fall.

So, they came to an avenue that was darker than the rest, and were pressing forward on their journey without looking down it when the lady stopped.

"My husband," said the lady. "I am called."

They listened, and they heard a voice a long way down the avenue, say, "Mother, mother!"

It was the voice of the first child who had said, "I am going to Heaven!" and the father said, "I pray not yet. The sunset is very near. I pray not yet!"

But, the voice cried, "Mother, mother!" without minding him, though his hair was now quite white, and tears were on his face.

Then, the mother, who was already drawn into the shade of the dark avenue and moving away with her arms still round his neck, kissed him, and said, "My dearest, I am summoned, and I go!" And she was gone. And the traveller and he were left alone together.

And they went on and on together, until they came to very near the end of the wood: so near, that they could see the sunset shining red before them through the trees.

Yet, once more, while he broke his way among the branches, the traveller lost his friend. He called and called, but there was no reply, and when he passed out of the wood, and saw the peaceful sun going down upon a wide purple prospect, he came to an old man sitting on a fallen tree. So, he said to the old man, "What do you do here?" And the old man said with a calm smile, "I am always remembering. Come and remember with me!"

So the traveller sat down by the side of that old man, face to face with the serene sunset; and all his friends came softly back and stood around him. The beautiful child, the handsome boy, the young man in love, the father, mother, and children: every one of them was there, and he had lost nothing. So, he loved them all, and was kind and forbearing with them all, and was always pleased to watch them all, and they all honoured and loved him. And I think the traveller must be yourself, dear Grandfather, because this is what you do to us, and what we do to you.",

"translation": " 乔安娜·帕雷西是家里最后一个人——这个做了数百年集市商贩的家族，如今只剩她在世。她出生在高山脚下的一个村庄，一辈子都没离开过那里。山顶上长着石果。秋天，石果会从山上滚落。大多数石果都遗失了，再也找不回来。但有些果子会掉进一个小山谷。乔安娜的家族是唯一知道这个山谷的人。  石果刚从树上掉下来时，又黑又硬。要经过漫长的四个月才能成熟。它们会从黑色变成灰色，最后变成银色。这时，人们就能品尝到里面甜丝丝、带着阳光色泽的果肉了。  成熟的石果美味极了，是当地最受欢迎的食物。集市日那天，人们早早起床，排队好几个小时就为了买它。乔安娜家的石果总是比别家多，这些年来靠卖石果赚了不少钱。但比起那些把商品卖到遥远首都的商贩，他们还不算富有。  乔安娜小时候问过妈妈：“我们为什么不去首都卖石果呢？那里有全国最重要的集市啊。”妈妈告诉她，曾经有人试过，但失败了，却没再多说什么。  岁月流逝，乔安娜一直梦想着能在首都的集市上卖石果。妈妈去世后的那个春天，她决定出发。步行去首都要花整整四个月——正好是石果成熟所需的时间。这段旅程会很艰难……但并非不可能。  城里人第一次尝到石果，一定会喜欢的。而且最重要的是，他们会付很高的价钱。她能赚到比以往任何时候都多的钱。  *****  乔安娜一路步行去了首都。她推着一辆装满石果的木车，还带着一个漂亮的木制集市摊位。这个摊位曾属于妈妈，再之前是外婆的。她要在这个摊位上卖自己的石果。终于抵达首都时，数月的旅途让她疲惫不堪，但石果也快成熟了。到目前为止，她的计划还算顺利。  当然，进城要交城门税，在集市摆摊也要缴费。而且，在集市上卖她这种新奇的食物并不容易——石果必须经过检测，证明可以安全食用。检测费用不低，还需要好几天才能完成。  乔安娜把所有的钱都花在了检测上。等待检测结果的日子里，她还需要地方住。她实在太需要钱了，只好卖掉了那个珍贵的家族摊位。她不想这么做，但别无选择。等卖掉石果，她就能把摊位赎回来了。  检测终于结束，她获准售卖石果。她用最后一点钱租了一个便宜的普通摊位。可这时，原本完美的银色石果已经变成了白色，失去了甜美的味道。  没有顾客愿意买她摊位上这些过熟的果子，它们看起来、闻起来都越来越差。最后，她把所有石果都卖给了一个农民喂猪，连木车也一起卖了，得到的钱远低于它们的价值。  她失去了一切。  乔安娜沮丧地离开了集市，走在首都的街道上。这里应有尽有。在一家店里，她看到了妈妈留给她的那个漂亮摊位——可她没钱赎回来。  眼泪顺着脸颊流下，她漫无目的地走着，直到在城里迷了路。最后，她在一个角落躺下，睡着了。  *****  乔安娜再次醒来时，天已经黑了。但对面墙上有个东西比夜色更暗——那是一个洞。  它不是门，因为没通到地面；也不是窗户，就只是个墙上的洞。洞里什么都没有——就像她一样。  乔安娜怒火中烧——既恨集市，也恨自己。她脱下一只靴子，这只靴子在漫长的旅途中已经破了好几个洞。她把靴子朝街对面的洞扔了过去。  靴子消失在洞里，却没有落地的声响。靴子没了——这又是她的愚蠢导致失去的一样东西。又累又难过，她闭上眼，对这个世界失去了兴趣。可就在这时，她听到了一个声音。  她再次睁开眼。  地上有个闪闪发光的东西——是一枚硬币，一便士。足够买一顿饭了，肯定比她那只旧靴子值钱。  她觉得这一定是个玩笑，等着有人出来嘲笑她。可什么都没发生。她脱下另一只靴子，跟着第一只扔了过去。她看着靴子飞进洞里，消失不见。但这次，她看到一枚硬币飞了出来，接着是第二枚、第三枚。  乔安娜捡起最近的那枚硬币，凑近脸看了看……是真的！  她把另外几枚也捡了起来：三便士。现在她能买新靴子了。  她解下腰带，朝洞扔了过去。腰带进了洞——更多硬币飞了出来。她把硬币都捡起来数了数：十便士。足够买新靴子和一条简单的腰带了！  乔安娜兴奋极了，赶紧脱下旅行外套、夹克和两只袜子，把每一样都扔进了洞里。  当硬币落在地上的声响停止时，她面前已经堆了一小堆硬币。她在接下来的整个夜晚，一遍又一遍地数着。  天亮时，墙上的洞消失了。或许除了失去石果、木车和妈妈的摊位，她连理智也丧失了。  没关系，她不在乎。她有三十八便士。  而作为一个优秀的商贩，你只需要一个起点。  *****  现在的乔安娜成了一个很特别的商贩。她没有鞋、袜子和外套，挨家挨户地逛商店。用那堆便士，她买了：  一个大袋子；  一件长衬衫；  一双破旧的木鞋；  其他商贩愿意卖给她的所有旧的、坏的或没用的东西。  花光所有钱后，乔安娜回到了昨晚过夜的那条街。她一整天都坐在那里，盯着对面空荡荡的墙。路人来来往往，有人为她感到难过，有人好奇她在做什么，但大多数人都没注意到她。  *****  午夜时分，墙上的洞又出现了。乔安娜很高兴，原来这不是她的幻觉。  她在洞前打开空袋子，然后把东西一件一件扔进洞里，连木鞋也扔了进去——只有袋子没扔。天亮时，袋子里装满了沉甸甸的硬币。  *****  乔安娜用这些钱买了新衣服：一顶好帽子、一件衬衫、一条裤子、一双能让她回家的靴子、一件适合山里冬天穿的厚外套，还有一个更大的新袋子。剩下的钱足够她再去集市买些东西了——她买了丝绸地毯、优质羊毛、几袋香料等等。  忙碌了一天后，她去了一家特别的商店——赎回了妈妈的摊位。然后，她带着在集市上买的所有好东西，回到了那条幸运的街。  她坐下等待那个洞，这是她在这里的最后一夜。  洞再次出现时，她开始把香料扔进去，接着是羊毛、丝绸和其他东西。金银硬币从洞里飞出来，落进袋子里。很快，袋子里的钱就多到她从未见过的程度。有那么一瞬间，她想把家族摊位也扔进洞里，但随即想到了一个更好的主意。  这个洞总是会给她比扔进东西价值更高的回报。那如果把这些金银硬币扔进去呢？洞会给她什么？  有什么东西会比她拥有的所有钱都值钱？  也许她再也不用卖石果了！乔安娜提起装满硬币的沉重袋子，前后晃动起来，越来越快……然后扔了出去。  五枚硬币从袋子里掉出来，落在乔安娜脚边，其他的都飞进了洞里。  乔安娜等着，盯着那个洞。但这一次，什么都没回来。  *****  出城也要交税。乔安娜最后那五枚硬币刚好够付。  她穿着新靴子和新衣服走出了城，背上背着妈妈的摊位。她白天赶路，晚上睡得很香，开心地踏上了回家的路。离首都越来越远，她能看到家乡的群山了——它们比以往任何时候都更美。  她的口袋空空如也，但内心却无比充实。  有时她会在路上遇到其他旅人。看到有人走来，她就支起那个漂亮的家族摊位。她唯一能卖的就是自己的故事，只收一两便士就能听。如果对方没钱，她就换些食物或水。没人相信她的故事是真的，但都相信故事里蕴含的道理。每个听过故事的人都学到了不同的东西：对有些人来说，道理是“知足常乐”或“贪得无厌终将一无所有”；对另一些人来说，是“智慧的代价高昂”。  而对乔安娜——这个家族最后一位商贩来说，道理却不同。这正是她那个问题的答案：什么东西比她拥有的所有钱都值钱？现在她知道了，答案是智慧。",

  "content": "Joanna Paresi was the last one left – the last living person in a family who had been market traders for hundreds of years. She was born in a village at the bottom of high mountains, and she had lived there all her life. At the top of the mountains, the stone fruit grew. In autumn, the fruit fell down the mountains. Most of the stone fruit got lost and no one could find them again. But some fruit fell into a small valley. Joanna's family were the only people who knew about the valley.

When the stone fruit fell from the trees, they were black and hard. It took four long months for them to become ripe. They turned from black to grey and, finally, to silver. Then people could enjoy the sweet, sun-coloured fruit inside. 

When it was ripe, the stone fruit was delicious. It was the most popular food in the region. On market day, people got up early and queued for hours to buy it. Joanna's family always had more fruit to sell than anyone else. Her family had made a lot of money by selling the fruit over the years. But they were not as rich as the market sellers who sold their products far away in the capital city. 

When Joanna was a child, she asked her mother, 'Why don't we go to the capital city to sell the fruit? That's where the most important market in the country is.' Her mother told her that someone had tried once, and they had failed. But she didn't say any more. 

As the years passed, Joanna dreamed of selling stone fruit at the market in the capital. The spring after her mother died, she decided to go. It would take four long months to walk to the capital city. It was exactly how long it took the fruit to become ripe. It would be difficult … but it was possible.

When the people in the city tried stone fruit for the first time, they would love it. And, best of all, they would pay a lot. She would earn more money than ever before. 

Joanna walked all the way to the capital city. She pushed a wooden cart full of stone fruit. She carried with her a beautiful wooden market stall. The stall had belonged to her mother, and before that to Joanna's grandmother. On this stall, she would sell her fruit. When she finally arrived at the city, she was very tired after months on the road. But the stone fruit were almost ripe. So far, her plan was working.

Of course, there was a tax to enter the city gates. And there were market fees to pay. Plus, it wasn't easy to sell strange, new foods like hers at the market. The fruit had to be tested to prove it was safe to eat. The tests were not cheap and they took days to do.

Joanna spent all her money on the tests. And she also needed a place to sleep while she waited. She really needed money, so she sold her beautiful family stall. She didn't want to do it, but she had no choice. After she sold the fruit, she could buy the stall back.

Finally, the tests were finished and she was allowed to sell her fruit. She used the last of her money to rent a cheap, ordinary stall. But by now the perfect, silver stone fruit had turned white and lost their sweet flavour. 

No customers wanted to buy her overripe fruits from her boring stall. They were starting to look and smell bad. In the end, she sold all the stone fruit to a farmer to feed his pigs. He bought her cart too, and paid her much less than its value.

She had lost everything.

Joanna left the market in defeat. She walked through the city streets. There were shops of every kind. In one she saw the beautiful stall that her mother had given her. But she had no money to buy it back.

Tears ran down her face, and she walked until she was lost in the city streets. At last, she lay down in a corner and fell asleep.

When Joanna woke again, it was dark. But there was something even darker on the wall opposite her. It was a hole in the wall.

It wasn't a door, because it didn't reach the ground. It wasn't a window either. This was just a hole in the wall. It had … nothing. Just like her.

Joanna felt so angry – with the market and with herself. She pulled off one of her boots. It was full of holes from her long journey. She threw it across the street at the hole.

It disappeared into the hole, but there was no sound as it landed. The boot was gone. It was just one more thing that she had lost by being stupid. Tired and sad, she closed her eyes on the world. But then she heard a sound.

She opened her eyes again.

There was something shiny on the ground. It was a coin – a single penny. It was enough to buy a meal. It was definitely worth more than her old boot.

It must be a joke, she thought. She waited for someone to come out and start laughing at her. But nothing happened. She pulled off her other boot and threw it after the first. She saw it fly through the hole into nothing. But this time she saw another coin fly back out, then a second and a third.

Joanna picked up the nearest coin. She held it close to her face … It was real!

She picked up the other coins: three pennies. She could buy new boots now. 

She took off her belt and threw it at the hole. In it went – and more coins flew back out. She picked those up too and counted them: ten pennies. Enough for new boots and a simple belt!

Excited, she quickly took off her travelling coat, her jacket and both socks. She threw each one into the hole. 

When the sound of metal falling on the ground ended, she had a small pile of coins. She counted them, over and over, through the rest of the night.

When morning came, the hole in the wall had disappeared. Perhaps she had lost her mind as well as her fruit, her cart and her mother's stall. 

Fine. She didn't care. She had thirty-eight pennies.

And if you're a good trader, all you need is somewhere to start.

Joanna was now a very unusual trader. She had no shoes, socks or coat. She went from shop to shop. With her pile of pennies, she bought:

a large bag;

a long shirt;

a pair of broken wooden shoes;

all the old, broken or useless things the other traders would sell her. 

When she had spent all her money, Joanna returned to the street where she had spent the night. All day she sat there, looking at the empty wall opposite. People walked past her. Some felt sorry for her. Others wondered what she was doing. But most people didn't pay her any attention. 


In the middle of the night, the hole in the wall appeared again. Joanna was happy that she hadn't imagined it.

She opened the empty bag in front of the hole. Then, one by one, she threw things into the hole. Even the wooden shoes went in. The only thing she didn't throw in was the bag. When the sun rose in the morning, the bag was full and heavy with coins.

Joanna bought new clothes with the money: a good hat, shirt and trousers, boots to take her home, a thick coat for winter in the mountains, and a new, bigger bag. She had enough money left to do some shopping at the market too. She bought silk carpets, fine wool, bags of spices and more. 

After a busy day, she returned to one, special shop. There she bought back her mother's stall. And then she went back to her lucky street with all the beautiful things she had bought at the market. 

She sat down for one last night, waiting for the hole.

When the hole appeared again, she started throwing the spices into it. Then she threw the wool and silk and the other things. Silver and gold coins flew out of the hole into the bag. Soon her bag was filled with more money than she had ever known. For a moment, she thought about throwing her family stall into the hole as well. But then she had a better idea. 

The hole had always given her more than the value of the things she threw into it. So what about the gold and silver coins? What would the hole give her if she threw all the money in? 

What could be worth more than all the money she had?

Maybe she would never have to sell stone fruit again! Joanna lifted the heavy bag of coins. She began to move the bag backwards and forwards, faster and faster … and then she threw it.

Five coins came out of the bag and fell by Joanna's feet. The others flew into the hole.

Joanna waited and watched the hole. But this time, nothing came back.

There was a tax to leave the city. Joanna's last five coins were just enough to pay it.

She walked out in her good boots and new clothes. On her back, she carried her mother's stall. She walked all day and she slept well at night. She was happy to be going home. As she got further and further away from the capital, she could see the mountains of home. They looked more beautiful than ever.

Her pockets were empty, but her heart was full.

Sometimes she met other travellers on the road. When she saw them coming, she put up her beautiful, family stall. The only thing she had to sell was her story. She only asked people to pay a penny or two to hear her story. If they didn't have any money, she asked for some food or drink. No one believed her story was true, but they believed the lessons her story contained. Everyone who heard the story learned a different lesson. For some people, the lesson was 'be happy with what you have' or 'if you want more than you need, you will lose everything.' For others, it was 'wisdom has a high price.'

For Joanna, the last trader in her family, the lesson was different. It was the answer to her question: What could be worth more than all the money she had? Now she knew the answer was wisdom. ",

"translation": " 托马斯·施特雷尔博士环顾控制室里他的科学家和工程师团队。他既兴奋又恐惧，但努力装作镇定。几分钟后，他们或许就能开始发现一件惊人的事：宇宙是如何起源的。  他望向窗外美丽的夏日蓝天，试着慢慢呼吸。  “准备就绪，”他说。按下第一个按钮，复杂的计算机和机器启动了。  “设定完成，”他说。按下第二个按钮，启动了位于瑞士城镇和田野下方的大型粒子加速器。  “开始，”他说。正午十二点整，他按下了最后一个按钮。  一瞬间，他感觉自己失明了，因为一切都变得漆黑一片。托马斯震惊地叫出声，但灯光已经重新亮起。这不在他的计划之内，他完全不知道刚刚发生了什么。  “所有人，检查系统！”他下令道。但系统似乎一切正常，粒子加速器运转得完美无缺。  “托马斯，”他的助手说，“快看外面。”她的声音里带着恐惧。  五分钟前那完美的夏日已然消失。取而代之的是，天空比最黑的夜晚还要昏暗。但这还不是最糟的——太阳不见了，月亮和星星也都消失了。  人们哭喊着、尖叫着，开始给家人打电话，担心他们也都消失了。托马斯感觉呼吸困难，但他数到十，试着慢慢呼吸。他坐在主计算机前，开始查看实验产生的信息和数据，却找不到任何能解释现状的线索。他和团队其他人一起冲出出口，直到所有人都站到了楼外。  大楼里的其他人也都出来了，一个个惊恐又困惑。他们打开手机屏幕和手电筒照亮四周，几个人钻进车里打开车灯，把车开到入口处，照亮一小块区域让大家聚集在一起。街灯也亮了，但大多数人依然惶恐不安。  然后，在托马斯启动粒子加速器将近二十分钟后，太阳重新出现在天空中。阳光温暖而金黄，漆黑的天空再次变回蓝色。所有人都开始欢呼起舞，托马斯也终于能正常呼吸了。  但后来，几小时后，当真正的夜晚来临时，没有人再开心了。因为尽管月亮再次升起，天空中却一颗星星也没有了。  ……  没人想知道托马斯的工作实际上是关于什么的，也没人在乎粒子加速器的用途。那些有什么重要的呢？他们只在乎他启动机器后发生的事。报纸称，他偷走了所有的星星。当他被送上国际刑事法院时，被指控的罪名是“偷窃星星”。  托马斯说：“我是无辜的。”  “好吧，施特雷尔博士，如果你没有偷星星，”控方律师说，“那你做了什么？”  “如果你问的是我的工作，”托马斯说，“我们什么也没做，只是证明了机器能正常运转而已。”  “把星星从天上弄消失对你来说就不算什么事吗？”律师环顾法庭上的人，“这里没人会觉得这不算事，全世界也没人会这么觉得。”  “我不是这个意思，”托马斯说，“但我可以告诉你：机器启动时，测试室里突然没有光子了。”  “什么？光子？我们这里不都是科学家！说点简单易懂的英语，施特雷尔博士！”  “就是光，”托马斯说，“有那么一瞬间，我们的实验室里仿佛没有任何光。然后我们发现外面也变黑了……直到光线恢复正常。”  “正常，施特雷尔博士？当……”——律师查看了一下笔记——“……太阳整整消失了十六分四十秒的时候，这能叫正常吗？或许我们可以说那天剩下的时间是正常的，但从那以后的夜晚就再也不正常了，不是吗？”  托马斯神色悲伤：“我知道。但你们必须相信我，我没有做任何可能导致星星从天上消失的事！”  “所以你是说你没有偷走我们的星星？”律师问。  “不，我没有偷，”托马斯说。  “你只是让我们再也看不到它们了而已。”  长时间的沉默后，托马斯开口了：“是的。”  “这有什么区别吗？”律师追问。  托马斯没有答案，至少没有一个能让别人理解的答案。就算他们理解了，也不会相信他。他有一个猜想，但要证明它需要好几年时间。  于是，他改变了主意，说：“我有罪。”  ……  现在，全世界终于有了可以怪罪的对象，为他们失去的东西负责。但把托马斯关进监狱好几年毫无意义，这改变不了任何事。相反，他们为他量身设计了一种惩罚。  他们把托马斯派到智利帕瑞纳的超大望远镜工作。现在没人使用这台望远镜了，也没有游客来到这些高山上观赏星系边缘的景色，没有科学家申请资金研究这片空荡荡的天空。夜空中只有孤独的月亮和几颗行星划过，抬头望去只会让人心情沉重。  托马斯觉得这样的惩罚是公平的。这份工作几乎和监狱没两样，因为他彻底孤身一人。几年后，世界忘记了他，至少所有人都决定不再打扰他。每天傍晚，他都会看着太阳下山。这个红色的球体在实际落到地球后面八分二十秒后才消失。托马斯略感欣慰，因为这说明物理定律依然没变，光的传播速度和以往一样。他希望这意味着他没有对宇宙造成太大的改变。他想，我们知道光有传播速度，或许黑暗也有同样的传播速度。  当然，目前还没有办法证明他的猜想。而且，在这高山之上，托马斯也无人可以分享他的想法。  ……  在智利的高山上，托马斯继续观察着夜空。他每天晚上都用这台巨大的望远镜对准空无一物的天空中同一个位置，尽管那里什么也看不见。每当太阳下山时，他就会想起小时候父母唱给他听的那首歌：  星光闪耀，  今晚我看到的第一颗星，  愿我可以，愿我能够，  实现我今晚的心愿。  整整1596个漆黑的夜晚——将近四年半的时间里，夜空没有任何变化。但这没关系，并不意味着他的猜想是错的。托马斯思考着自己创造的黑暗，把它想象成一道已经掠过太阳的波浪。现在，这道波浪或许正继续向星系边缘推进，甚至更远，朝着星星的方向。要到达最近的星星，需要1596个夜晚；而那颗星星的光要重新回到地球，又需要另外1596个夜晚……当然，前提是这道波浪真的存在，他的猜想是正确的。如果他错了，星星就真的永远消失了。  ……  然后，在1596个夜晚之后，距离那个可怕的日子将近九年的时候，托马斯从望远镜前抬起头。半人马座阿尔法星正在夜空中向他闪烁着光芒。  第一颗星。  他热泪盈眶，许下了一个心愿。他想象着，此刻还有数百万人也在许下他们的心愿。",

  "content": "Dr Tomas Streyer looked around the control room at his team of scientists and engineers. He was excited and frightened but he tried to seem calm. In a few minutes, they might start to discover something amazing: how the universe began.

He looked out of the window at the beautiful blue summer sky and tried to breathe slowly.

'Ready,' he said. He pressed the first button and the complicated computers and machines came to life.

'Set,' he said. He pressed the second button and switched on the large particle accelerator that lay under the towns and fields of Switzerland. 

'Go,' he said. And, at exactly twelve o'clock, he pressed the final button.

For a second, he felt as if he was blind, because everything went completely black. Tomas shouted in shock, but the lights were already on again. That was not part of his plan. He had no idea what had just happened.

'Everybody, check the systems!' he ordered. But nothing seemed to be wrong with them. The particle accelerator was working perfectly.  

'Tomas,' said his assistant. 'Look outside.' She sounded afraid.

The perfect summer's day of five minutes ago had gone. Instead, the sky was darker than the blackest night. But that wasn't the worst thing. The sun wasn't there, and the moon and stars were also gone.

People were shouting and screaming. They started calling their families on the telephone because they were afraid they had all gone too. Tomas felt as if it was hard to breathe, but he counted to ten and tried to breathe slowly. He sat at the main computer and started reading the information and numbers from his experiment. But he couldn’t find anything to explain what was happening. He ran out of the exit with the rest of his team until they were all outside the building. 

Everyone else in the building was outside, frightened and confused. They were using the screens and lights on their mobile phones to see better. Several people got in their cars and turned on the lights. They drove to the entrance to make a small area of light for everybody to stand together. The street lights turned on, but most people were still afraid. 

Then, almost twenty minutes after Tomas had started the particle accelerator, the sun was in the sky again. It was warm and yellow, and the black sky turned blue again. Everyone started laughing and dancing around, and Tomas felt as if he could breathe normally again. 

But later, hours later, when the real night began, no one was happy. Because, although the moon rose again, there were no stars in the sky at all.

…

No one wanted to know what Tomas' work was actually about. They didn't care what the particle accelerator was for. What did that matter? All they cared about was what had happened after he turned the machine on. He had stolen all the stars – or that's what the newspapers said. And when they made him go to the International Criminal Court, they charged him with stealing the stars. 

Tomas said, 'I'm not guilty.'

'Well, if you didn’t steal the stars, Dr Streyer,' said the lawyer for the prosecution, 'what did you do?'

'If you're asking about my work,' said Tomas, 'we didn't do anything. We showed that the machine was working, that's all.'

'Taking the stars from the sky seems like nothing to you?' The lawyer looked around at the people in the court. 'No one here would think it's nothing. No one in the world would think it's nothing.'

'That's not what I meant,' said Tomas. 'But I can tell you this: when the machine started, there were suddenly no photons in the test room.'

'What? Photons? We aren't all scientists here! Speak simple English, Dr Streyer!'

'Light,' said Tomas. 'For just a moment it was as if there was no light in our laboratory. Then we saw it was also dark outside … until the light became normal again.'

'Normal, Dr Streyer? It wasn't normal when …' – the lawyer checked his notes – '… the sun went out for exactly sixteen minutes and forty seconds. Perhaps we can say the rest of the day was normal. But the night hasn't been normal ever since, has it?'

Tomas looked sad. 'I know. But you must believe me. I didn't do anything that could have taken the stars from the sky!'

'So are you saying you didn't steal the stars from us?' said the lawyer.

'No, I didn't steal them,' Tomas said.

'You just made it so that we can't see them any more.'

After a long pause, Tomas spoke. 'Yes,' he said.

'How is that any different?' the lawyer asked.

Tomas didn't have an answer, not one anyone would understand anyway. And if they understood it, they wouldn't believe him. He had an idea, but it would take years to prove it.

Instead, he changed his mind and said, 'I'm guilty.'

…

Now the world could blame someone for what it had lost. But there was no point sending Tomas to prison for years. It wouldn't change anything. Instead, they designed a punishment especially for him. 

They sent Tomas to work at the Extremely Large Telescope in Paranal in Chile. Nobody used the telescope now. No tourists came to these high mountains to see the edges of our galaxy. No scientists asked for money to study the empty sky. All that passed through the night sky was the lonely moon and a few planets. Looking up made people feel bad.

Tomas thought it was fair that they punished him. And the job was almost the same as prison because he was completely alone. After a few years, the world forgot about him. Or, at least, everyone decided to leave him alone. Every evening he watched the sun go down. The red ball was gone exactly eight minutes and twenty seconds after it actually went behind the Earth. Tomas was almost happy to know that the laws of physics remained the same. Light still travelled at the same speed as it had always travelled. He hoped it meant he hadn't changed the universe that much. We know there is a speed light travels at, he thought, so perhaps the dark travels at the same speed. 

Of course, there was no way to prove his idea. Not yet. And, alone in the mountains, Tomas had nobody to share his idea with anyway.

…

High in the mountains of Chile, Tomas continued to watch the night sky. With the enormous telescope, he looked at the same place in the empty sky every night, even though there was nothing to see. And each day as the sun went down, he thought of the song his parents sang to him as a child:

 

Star light, star bright,
First star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might,
Have the wish I wish tonight.

 

For 1,596 black nights – nearly four and a half years – there was no change to the night sky. But that was OK. It didn't mean his idea was wrong. Tomas thought about the darkness he had created. He imagined it like a wave that had passed the sun. Now, maybe, it was continuing out towards the edge of our galaxy and further, to the stars. It would take 1,596 nights to pass the nearest star. It would take 1,596 more nights for that star's light to come back to Earth ... If the wave was real, of course. If his ideas were correct. If he was wrong, the stars were really gone forever. 

…

And then one night 1,596 nights later, almost nine years after that terrible day, Tomas looked up from his telescope. There was Alpha Centauri twinkling back at him from the night sky.

The first star.

He felt tears in his eyes and he made a wish. And he imagined millions of other people were making their wishes too.",

"translation":  维多利亚正要开门，前门就传来了敲门声——奇怪的是，她既没听到电梯运行的声音，也没听到楼梯上有人走动。她单脚站着穿另一只鞋，脚下踩着一摞未拆封的账单，差点滑倒。这是她这个月第三次上班迟到，现在居然还有访客。真是糟透了。  她打开门，勉强挤出一个微笑，希望这个微笑能传达“我很乐意聊天，但抱歉我赶时间”的意思。  “今天过得怎么样，维多利亚？”门口的男人问道，“希望一切都好！如果不好也没关系，我带来了我们公司伟大总裁永恒的温暖和最诚挚的祝福。”  维多利亚的笑容瞬间消失了。他怎么知道她的名字？  “你想知道我为什么这么确定吗？因为我就是我们公司伟大的总裁！”他眨了眨眼说。  “抱歉，”维多利亚说，“我赶时间，上班要迟到了。”  “时间！”他咂了咂舌头，“所有人都想要时间。时间和幸福，你更想要哪一个？”  “听着，说真的，”维多利亚说，“我没兴趣，抱歉。”  “我们有个特别优惠，”他回答，“用永恒来换二十五年额外的生命。或者，”他咧嘴一笑，“用同样的代价，让你的幸福翻倍。”  “代价？”她重复道，尽管这远不是他那句话里最奇怪的部分。  “没错，一口价，没有隐藏费用。我们会拿走你拥有的一切——永远。”  他居然浪费宝贵的推销时间说这些废话，真是奇怪。“那我要五十年额外生命，或者四倍的幸福。”她开玩笑说。  “哦，你可以选。但我得提醒你，超出标准二十五年的那些年份，质量不一定有保障。我建议你选幸福。”  他帮她按了电梯按钮。当然，看她这时候的穿着打扮，显然是要下楼去上班。好吧，她的衬衫没熨烫，因为没时间；那个看起来很重要的公文包，里面其实装的是午餐三明治，因为她没钱和同事一起出去吃。而且，她连休息时间都在工作，拼命想挤出更多时间完成堆积如山的工作。总有一天，她会找到自己梦想的工作——前提是她先搞清楚自己的梦想是什么。  有时候，维多利亚觉得家里所有的好运都被姐姐占了。姐姐不仅经营着一家获奖的出版公司，还嫁给了一个同样优秀的男人——英俊又风趣的彼得，他唯一的缺点就是没有双胞胎兄弟。就连他们相遇的经历，听起来都像电影情节。夏洛特曾经运气很差，最后还遭遇了一场车祸，差点再也无法走路。彼得是医院的新医生，不得不为她做了几次高风险的手术，当时大家都觉得手术不会成功，但几周后她就恢复了行走能力。就连彼得自己都开玩笑说，他以前都不知道自己是这么厉害的外科医生。两个月后，他向夏洛特求婚了。车祸半年后，夏洛特创办了自己的公司，现在他们住在伦敦最昂贵的地段。维多利亚努力不让自己嫉妒姐姐——不嫉妒她的丈夫，不嫉妒她成功的事业，不嫉妒他们漂亮的房子，也不嫉妒他们的孩子——但那种幸福，她真希望自己也能体验一下。  想到夏洛特的车祸，她就想起未来的事真是难以预料。“可万一我明天被公交车撞了呢？”  “那你至少在那一天会过得无比幸福。时间或幸福，我只能提供一个。我不是奇迹创造者，那是另一家公司的业务。”  他又眨了眨眼。  “那你或许应该换份工作。”她说着，自己按了一下电梯按钮。  他摇了摇头：“我试过了。他们的销售团队方法完全不同——现在吃苦，然后永恒幸福。那方法确实有吸引力，但说实话，推销起来难得多。”  电梯根本没动。她转向楼梯。“迟到”两个字都不足以形容她上班会迟到多久。但就在她开始下楼时，突然想起了一件事。  “该死！”她咒骂了一声。她忘了拿给小侄女们的生日礼物。现在回去拿已经来不及了。安吉拉和加布丽埃拉完美的生日派对，将会缺少她们不完美的姨妈送的两份包装粗糙的礼物。总有一天，她们会长大，会疑惑自己的妈妈怎么会和维多利亚是姐妹。  “是时候做决定了，对吧，维多利亚？我总能看出来。”他在她身后喊道。  “就算我相信你说的这些荒唐话，我也没时间跟你讨论……”  她突然停住了，懊恼自己承认了需要更多时间。接着，她尖叫了一声——只见他顺着楼梯扶手滑了下来，突然出现在她面前，双臂交叉、双腿盘起地悬浮在空中。  “那就选幸福吧！”他说着，挠了挠自己头上的两个小角——维多利亚这才注意到他脑袋两侧各有一个角。  维多利亚立刻把手从扶手上拿开，另一只手撑着墙，以免摔倒。粗糙的砖块刮到了她的指甲，有两个指甲从根部裂开了。疼痛让她再次尖叫，但现在她确定了他是谁，根本不敢停下脚步。  “我现在就很幸福，谢谢。”她一边说，一边用尽力气忍着痛，拖着两个流血的手指跑下楼。  “你真的幸福吗，维多利亚？”他顺着扶手跟在她身边，问道，“当然，你热爱自己的工作，不管薪水多低；也不在乎老板因为你总是迟到而讨厌你。你总会想办法交房租的，你向来很有办法。”  “你不可能知道这些！”她喊道，“而且，金钱买不到幸福！金钱是万恶之源。”  “说得对，维多利亚，说得对。非常明智。是爱让世界运转。”  “没错！”她说，终于在争辩中占了上风。还有五层楼。  “我相信总有一天你会遇到对的人……”他说。  “我不需要男人也能幸福，所以如果你所谓的幸福就只有这些……”  “真明智，维多利亚。”他继续说道，“很少有人意识到，幸福源于内心，而不是物质或他人。看得出来，你比我们很多客户都聪明。那就选二十五年额外生命吧。我能看出来，维多利亚，你不会浪费这些时间的。”  “不过，是在我原本寿命的基础上再加二十五年吗？”  “不，不，不。”他跟着她转过最后一个拐角，“我不会告诉你你原本能活多久，因为那样你就会知道自己还剩多少时间。我们以前试过那样做，结果人们只会把一切搞砸。细则里写着呢，但换作是我，我不会去读那些细则。”  “我不相信这些鬼话，也不相信你！”  他从扶手上跳下来，鞠了一躬，递给她一个小小的白色东西。  “你姐姐以前也不相信，”他说，“直到她遭遇了那场车祸。如果你改变主意，打这张名片上的电话。”  说完，他就消失了，只留下维多利亚愣在原地，手里拿着那张名片，嘴巴惊讶地张着。",

  "content": "The knock at her front door came just as Victoria was about to open it, even though, strangely, she'd heard neither the lift nor anyone on the stairs. She balanced on one foot while she put on her other shoe, slipping on piles of unopened bills. She was late to work for the third time this month and now she had a visitor. Great.

She opened the door and forced her mouth into a smile she hoped said, 'I'd love to chat, but sorry I can't!'.

'And how are we today, Victoria?' the man at her door asked. 'Good, I hope! If not, I bring you an eternity of warmth and best wishes from the wonderful director of my company.'

Victoria's smile vanished. How did he know her name? 

'You know how I can be so sure? I am the wonderful director of my company!' he said, winking.

'I'm sorry,' said Victoria. 'I'm in a rush. I'm late for work.'

'Time!' He clicked his tongue. 'That's what they all want. Time or happiness, which one would you like more of?'

'Listen, really,' said Victoria, 'I'm not interested, sorry.' 

'We've got a special offer on,' he replied. 'Twenty-five years of extra life in exchange for eternity. Or,' he smiled widely, 'double your happiness for the same price.'

'Price?' she repeated, despite it being far from the strangest part of his sentence.

'Yes, it's a fixed price, no hidden charges. We take everything you have – forever.'

It was strange that he was wasting his precious selling time on talking nonsense. 'Then I want fifty extra years or four times more happiness,' she joked.

'Oh, you could. But I have to warn you, the quality of the years after the standard twenty-five isn't always as high. I'd go for happiness.'

He pushed the lift button for her. Of course, it was obvious, at this time of day, dressed for work, that she was about to go down. OK, so her shirt wasn't ironed because she hadn't had time and her very-important-looking briefcase actually contained sandwiches for lunch because she couldn't afford to join her colleagues eating out for lunch. Plus, she worked through her breaks, desperately trying to find extra time for all the work she had to do. One day, she'd get her dream job – just as soon as she knew what that was. 

Sometimes Victoria felt as if her sister had all the luck in the family. Not only did she run her own award-winning publishing company, she'd married an equally talented man, the gorgeous and funny Peter, whose only fault was not having a twin. Even the way they met sounded like the plot of a film. Charlotte had been having a run of bad luck, ending in a car accident that had threatened to leave her unable to walk. Peter, a new doctor at the hospital, had to perform several risky operations that they had thought wouldn't work, but she was back on her feet within weeks. Even he joked that he hadn't known he was such a good surgeon. He proposed two months later. Half a year after the accident, Charlotte had set up her company and now they lived in the most expensive part of London. Victoria tried not to be jealous of her sister for any of it – not the husband, not the successful business, not their beautiful house nor their children – but it was a level of happiness that she wished she could taste for herself.

Thinking about Charlotte's accident reminded her how impossible it was to know what might happen. 'But what if I get run over by a bus tomorrow?'

'Then you'll have been blissfully happy for that one day. Time or happiness, I can only offer one. I'm not a miracle worker. That's another company.'

He winked again.

'Well, maybe you should change jobs,' she said and pressed the lift button herself.  

He shook his head. 'I've tried them. Their sales team has quite a different approach. Be miserable now, then happy for eternity. It has its appeal but, honestly, it's a much harder sell.'

The lift wasn't even moving. She turned towards the stairs. 'Late' didn't begin to describe the time she would get to work. But as she started down the stairs, she suddenly remembered something.

'Damn!' she swore. She hadn't picked up her little nieces' birthday presents. There wasn't time to go back and get them now. Angela and Gabriella's perfect birthday party would be minus two messily wrapped presents from their imperfect auntie. One day they'd be old enough to wonder how their mother could be related to Victoria.

'It's time, isn't it, Victoria. I can always tell,' he called after her.

'Even if I believed this ridiculous stuff you're saying, I don't have time to discuss it with you ...'

She broke off, annoyed with herself for admitting she needed more time, and then let out a little scream as he slid down the banister and suddenly appeared in front of her, floating in the air with his arms and legs crossed. 

'Then it's happiness!' he said, scratching one of two little horns that she now noticed on either side of his head.

Victoria pulled her hand off the banister and put her other hand against the wall so she wouldn't fall. She caught her nails on the rough bricks, feeling two of them break where they joined the skin. The pain made her scream again, but she didn't stop to look now she was sure who he was.

'I'm happy enough, thanks,' she said, with as much strength in her voice as she could while running down the stairs with two bleeding fingers. 

'Are you happy, Victoria?' he asked as he continued sliding down the banister with her. 'Of course, you love your job, however low paid it is and never mind the fact that your boss hates you because you're never on time. You'll find the rent somehow, you always do. So resourceful.'

'You can't know that!' she shouted. 'Anyway, money doesn't buy happiness! It's the root of all evil.'

'True, Victoria, true. Very wise. It's love that makes the world go round.'

'Exactly!' she said, winning a point finally. Five more floors to go. 

'I'm sure one day you'll meet someone ...' he said. 

'I don't need a man to be happy, so if that's all you've got in your happy bag ...' 

'So wise, Victoria,' he continued. 'So few people realise happiness comes from within, not from material things or other people. I see you're cleverer than many of our customers. Twenty-five years extra, then. I can see it in you, Victoria. You won't waste them.'

'Twenty-five on top of what, though?'

'No, no, no.' He turned the final corner with her. 'I won't tell you how long you would have lived, because then you'll know how long you've got left. We've tried that before. People just ruin it for themselves. It's in the small print but I wouldn't read that if I were you.'

'I don't believe in this stuff. Or in you!'

He jumped off the banister and bowed, holding something small and white out to her.

'Neither did your sister,' he said. 'Not until she had her accident. My card if you change your mind.'

And he disappeared, leaving Victoria with the card in her hand and her mouth open in shock.",

好书就像是你最好的朋友。它始终不渝，过去如此，现在如此，将来也永远不变。它是最有耐心，最令人愉悦的伴侣。在我们穷愁潦倒，临危遭难时，它也不会抛弃我们，对我们总是一如既往地亲切。在我们年轻时，好书陶冶我们的性情，增长我们的知识；到我们年老时，它又给我们以慰藉和勉励。
人们常常因为喜欢同一本书而结为知已，就像有时两个人因为敬慕同一个人而成为朋友一样。有句古谚说道：“爱屋及屋。”其实“爱我及书”这句话蕴涵更多的哲理。书是更为真诚而高尚的情谊纽带。人们可以通过共同喜爱的作家沟通思想，交流感情，彼此息息相通，并与自己喜欢的作家思想相通，情感相融。
好书常如最精美的宝器，珍藏着人生的思想的精华，因为人生的境界主要就在于其思想的境界。因此，最好的书是金玉良言和崇高思想的宝库，这些良言和思想若铭记于心并多加珍视，就会成为我们忠实的伴侣和永恒的慰藉。
书籍具有不朽的本质，是为人类努力创造的最为持久的成果。寺庙会倒坍，神像会朽烂，而书却经久长存。对于伟大的思想来说，时间是无关紧要的。多年前初次闪现于作者脑海的伟大思想今日依然清新如故。时间惟一的作用是淘汰不好的作品，因为只有真正的佳作才能经世长存。
书籍介绍我们与最优秀的人为伍，使我们置身于历代伟人巨匠之间，如闻其声，如观其行，如见其人，同他们情感交融，悲喜与共，感同身受。我们觉得自己仿佛在作者所描绘的舞台上和他们一起粉墨登场。
即使在人世间，伟大杰出的人物也永生不来。他们的精神被载入书册，传于四海。书是人生至今仍在聆听的智慧之声，永远充满着活力。",

  "content": "A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps; for there is a companionship of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company, whether it be of books or of men.

A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age.

Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb, ‘Love me, love my dog.” But there is more wisdom in this:” Love me, love my book.” The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author. They live in him together, and he in them.

A good book is often the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out; for the world of a man’s life is, for the most part, but the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are treasuries of good words, the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters.

Books possess an essence of immortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author’s minds, ages ago. What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed page. The only effect of time have been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive e but what is really good.

Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they said and did; we see the as if they were really alive; we sympathize with them, enjoy with them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe.

The great and good do not die, even in this world. Embalmed in books, their spirits walk abroad. The book is a living voice. It is an intellect to which on still listens.",

"translation": 一个缺乏抱负的世界将会怎样，这不难想象。或许，这将是一个更为友善的世界：没有渴求，没有磨擦，没有失望。人们将有时间进行反思。他们所从事的工作将不是为了他们自身，而是为了整个集体。竞争永远不会介入；冲突将被消除。人们的紧张关系将成为过往云烟。创造的重压将得以终结。艺术将不再惹人费神，其功能将纯粹为了庆典。人的寿命将会更长，因为由激烈拼争引起的心脏病和中风所导致的死亡将越来越少。焦虑将会消失。时光流逝，抱负却早已远离人心。
啊，长此以往人生将变得多么乏味无聊！
有一种盛行的观点认为，成功是一种神话，因此抱负亦属虚幻。这是不是说实际上并不丰在成功？成就本身就是一场空？与诸多运动和事件的力量相比，男男女女的努力显得微不足？显然，并非所有的成功都值得景仰，也并非所有的抱负都值得追求。对值得和不值得的选择，一个人自然而然很快就能学会。但即使是最为愤世嫉俗的人暗地里也承认，成功确实存在，成就的意义举足轻重，而把世上男男女女的所作所为说成是徒劳无功才是真正的无稽之谈。认为成功不存在的观点很可能造成混乱。这种观点的本意是一笔勾销所有提高能力的动机，求取业绩的兴趣和对子孙后代的关注。
我们无法选择出生，无法选择父母，无法选择出生的历史时期与国家，或是成长的周遭环境。我们大多数人都无法选择死亡，无法选择死亡的时间或条件。但是在这些无法选择之中，我们的确可以选择自己的生活方式：是勇敢无畏还是胆小怯懦，是光明磊落还是厚颜无耻，是目标坚定还是随波逐流。我们决定生活中哪些至关重要，哪些微不足道。我们决定，用以显示我们自身重要性的，不是我们做了什么，就是我们拒绝做些什么。但是不论世界对我们所做的选择和决定有多么漠不关心，这些选择和决定终究是我们自己做出的。我们决定，我们选择。而当我们决定和选择时，我们的生活便得以形成。最终构筑我们命运的就是抱负之所在。",

"title": "A Tent in Agony",

"translation": "曾经有四个男人来到一片无路可通的森林里的潮湿之地钓鱼。他们把帐篷搭在了长满松树的破碎岩石山脊的顶端，从那里推一块大圆石，就能让它穿过灌木丛，旋转着掠过树木，落到下方的湖边。他们睡在芬芳的铁杉树枝上，像失意的渔夫一样沉沉睡去——因为湖面上的阳光时而让他们慵懒，时而下雨又让他们浑身湿透。最后，他们吃完了最后一点熏肉，抽完了烟，烤焦了最后一块既可怕又奇妙的玉米饼。

立刻，一个小个子男人自告奋勇留下来看管营地，其余三个人则出发前往数英里外的沙利文县的一个农场采购物资。他们沮丧地看着他。“就你一个人——愿魔鬼给你造个双胞胎。”他们说着临别时的诅咒，便朝着远处一间小屋的方向下了山，消失不见了。到了晚上，铁杉树开始发出呜咽般的声响，他们还没有回来。小个子男人紧紧挨着他的伙伴——篝火，不断往里面添木头让它烧得更旺。他用力抽着一支粗制的石楠木烟斗，警惕地注视着周围无数仿佛要向他袭来的阴影。突然，他听到了未知事物靠近的声音，树枝噼啪作响，枯叶沙沙作响。小个子男人慢慢站起身，后背的衣服都绷得变形了，烟斗从嘴里掉了下来，膝盖不停地打颤。“哈！”他沙哑地咆哮着，试图威慑对方。一声低吼回应了他，一头熊踱步走进了火光中。小个子男人靠在一棵小树苗上，打量着这位不速之客。

这头熊显然是个老手，也是个斗士——因为岁月的流逝，它黑色的皮毛已经变成了黄褐色。它的步态中透着自信，小小的闪烁的眼睛里带着傲慢。它咧开嘴唇，露出雪白的牙齿。火光放大了它嘴巴的红色。小个子男人以前从未面对过如此可怕的生物，恐惧在他胸中挥之不去。“哈！”他再次怒吼。熊把这当成了角斗士的挑战，小心翼翼地靠近。当熊走近时，小个子男人突然被恐惧攫住，拔腿就跑，绕着篝火狂奔起来。“哼！”熊心里想，“这家伙不打算打架——只会跑。好吧，那我就追上它。”于是，它脸上露出了那种目标明确的野兽般的神情，开始紧紧跟着小个子男人绕篝火追逐。小个子男人尖叫着，疯狂地奔跑。他们绕着篝火跑了两圈。

天意有时会沉重地降临在正直的人身上——熊渐渐逼近了。

绝望之下，小个子男人冲进了帐篷。熊停下脚步，在帐篷入口处嗅了嗅，闻到了许多人的气味。最后，它大胆地钻了进去。

小个子男人蜷缩在帐篷遥远的角落里。熊匍匐前进，热血沸腾，毛发倒竖，嘴角流着口水。小个子男人大喊一声，笨拙地在帐篷尽头的门帘下挣扎着往外爬。熊发出可怕的咆哮，猛地一跳，去抓那即将消失的猎物。已经钻出帐篷的小个子男人感觉有一只巨大的爪子抓住了他的外套下摆。他扭动着身体，像一个被复仇者抓住的学童一样，从外套里挣脱出来。熊得意地翻滚着，把外套拖进帐篷，咬了两口，又捶又抱，才发现里面根本没有人。不过它并没有太生气——因为一头尽情胡闹的熊不像黑头发的海盗那样凶狠，它更像是一个街头混混。它仰面躺下，用四只爪子抓住外套，开始喧闹地玩了起来。最令人毛骨悚然、不寒而栗的嚎叫声传到了躲在树顶上哭泣的小个子男人耳中，让他浑身血液都凝固了。他呜咽着说了几句类似祈祷的话，紧紧抓住摇晃的树枝。他泪眼婆娑地望着他的伙伴——篝火，它正发出垂死的闪烁和噼啪声。最后，帐篷里传来一声盖过所有声响的咆哮，一声仿佛要撼动群山沉闷寂静、让花岗岩山峰都为之战栗的怒吼。小个子男人吓得浑身发抖，缩成一团，只剩下一双眼睛露在外面。在余烬的微光中，他看到白色的帐篷颤抖着轰然倒塌——熊欢快的玩耍弄倒了帐篷的中心支柱，一堆帆布混乱地压在了它的头上。

此刻，小个子男人目睹了一幕壮观的景象。帐篷开始摇摇晃晃地“挣扎前行”，朝着湖边的方向跌跌撞撞地挪动。帐篷里传来奇妙的声音——帆布的撕裂声、熊的呻吟声和喘息声。小个子男人忍不住歇斯底里地咯咯笑了起来。

这头被困的巨兽还没来得及挣脱出来，就已经疯狂地把帐篷撞向了山边。就在这时，三个背着包裹、提着篮子的男人爬上了山坡，看到他们的帐篷正朝自己移动过来。在他们眼中，帐篷就像一个被大黄蜂追赶的白袍幽灵，它的呻吟声惊动了铁杉树枝。

三个人扔下包裹，慌忙躲到一边，眼睛里闪烁着恐惧的光芒。帆布“雪崩”从他们身边席卷而过。他们虚弱地、一言不发地靠在树上，听着动静，血液仿佛都凝固了。帐篷在下方撞到了一棵巨大的松树根部，在那里扭动、挣扎。三个人看了一会儿帐篷的扭动，然后惊慌失措地朝着山顶跑去。就在他们消失的时候，熊奋力挣脱了束缚。它恶狠狠地、痛苦地看了一眼那堆白色的东西，然后疯狂地冲向森林深处。

这三个惊魂未定的人跑到重新燃起的篝火旁，小个子男人正平静地坐在那里抽着烟。他们冲到他面前，一连串的问题把他淹没了。小个子男人凝视着黑暗，夸张地长吸了一口烟斗。“就我一个人——不过魔鬼还真给我造了个双胞胎。”他说道。",

"content": "Four men once came to a wet place in the roadless forest to fish. They pitched their tent fair upon the brow of a pine-clothed ridge of riven rocks whence a bowlder could be made to crash through the brush and whirl past the trees to the lake below. On fragrant hemlock boughs they slept the sleep of unsuccessful fishermen, for upon the lake alternately the sun made them lazy and the rain made them wet. Finally they ate the last bit of bacon and smoked and burned the last fearful and wonderful hoecake.

Immediately a little man volunteered to stay and hold the camp while the remaining three should go the Sullivan county miles to a farmhouse for supplies. They gazed at him dismally. \"There's only one of you--the devil make a twin,\" they said in parting malediction, and disappeared down the hill in the known direction of a distant cabin. When it came night and the hemlocks began to sob they had not returned. The little man sat close to his companion, the campfire, and encouraged it with logs. He puffed fiercely at a heavy built brier, and regarded a thousand shadows which were about to assault him. Suddenly he heard the approach of the unknown, crackling the twigs and rustling the dead leaves. The little man arose slowly to his feet, his clothes refused to fit his back, his pipe dropped from his mouth, his knees smote each other. \"Hah!\" he bellowed hoarsely in menace. A growl replied and a bear paced into the light of the fire. The little man supported himself upon a sapling and regarded his visitor.

The bear was evidently a veteran and a fighter, for the black of his coat had become tawny with age. There was confidence in his gait and arrogance in his small, twinkling eye. He rolled back his lips and disclosed his white teeth. The fire magnified the red of his mouth. The little man had never before confronted the terrible and he could not wrest it from his breast. \"Hah!\" he roared. The bear interpreted this as the challenge of a gladiator. He approached warily. As he came near, the boots of fear were suddenly upon the little man's feet. He cried out and then darted around the campfire. \"Ho!\" said the bear to himself, \"this thing won't fight--it runs. Well, suppose I catch it.\" So upon his features there fixed the animal look of going--somewhere. He started intensely around the campfire. The little man shrieked and ran furiously. Twice around they went.

The hand of heaven sometimes falls heavily upon the righteous. The bear gained.

In desperation the little man flew into the tent. The bear stopped and sniffed at the entrance. He scented the scent of many men. Finally he ventured in.

The little man crouched in a distant corner. The bear advanced, creeping, his blood burning, his hair erect, his jowls dripping. The little man yelled and rustled clumsily under the flap at the end of the tent. The bear snarled awfully and made a jump and a grab at his disappearing game. The little man, now without the tent, felt a tremendous paw grab his coat tails. He squirmed and wriggled out of his coat like a schoolboy in the hands of an avenger. The bear bowled triumphantly and jerked the coat into the tent and took two bites, a punch and a hug before he, discovered his man was not in it. Then he grew not very angry, for a bear on a spree is not a black-haired pirate. He is merely a hoodlum. He lay down on his back, took the coat on his four paws and began to play uproariously with it. The most appalling, blood-curdling whoops and yells came to where the little man was crying in a treetop and froze his blood. He moaned a little speech meant for a prayer and clung convulsively to the bending branches. He gazed with tearful wistfulness at where his comrade, the campfire, was giving dying flickers and crackles. Finally, there was a roar from the tent which eclipsed all roars; a snarl which it seemed would shake the stolid silence of the mountain and cause it to shrug its granite shoulders. The little man quaked and shrivelled to a grip and a pair of eyes. In the glow of the embers he saw the white tent quiver and fall with a crash. The bear's merry play had disturbed the center pole and brought a chaos of canvas upon his head.

Now the little man became the witness of a mighty scene. The tent began to flounder. It took flopping strides in the direction of the lake. Marvellous sounds came from within--rips and tears, and great groans and pants. The little man went into giggling hysterics.

The entangled monster failed to extricate himself before he had walloped the tent frenziedly to the edge of the mountain. So it came to pass that three men, clambering up the hill with bundles and baskets, saw their tent approaching. It seemed to them like a white-robed phantom pursued by hornets. Its moans riffled the hemlock twigs.

The three men dropped their bundles and scurried to one side, their eyes gleaming with fear. The canvas avalanche swept past them. They leaned, faint and dumb, against trees and listened, their blood stagnant. Below them it struck the base of a great pine tree, where it writhed and struggled. The three watched its convolutions a moment and then started terrifically for the top of the hill. As they disappeared, the bear cut loose with a mighty effort. He cast one dishevelled and agonized look at the white thing, and then started wildly for the inner recesses of the forest.

The three fear-stricken individuals ran to the rebuilt fire. The little man reposed by it calmly smoking. They sprang at him and overwhelmed him with interrogations. He contemplated darkness and took a long, pompous puff. \"There's only one of me--and the devil made a twin,\" he said.",
